Certainly, here's a README.md file for your C++ Sensor Simulator:

# C++ Sensor Simulator

## Overview

The C++ Sensor Simulator is a tool designed to simulate sensor data for testing and development purposes. It reads a simulation file, generates random values within specified ranges, and produces sensor readings based on the simulation lines. This simulator allows you to test and validate your software without the need for actual hardware sensors.

## Features

- Simulate sensor data based on a simulation file's configuration.
- Generate random sensor values within specified minimum and maximum ranges.
- Simulate sensors concurrently for efficient testing.
- Highly customizable configuration for different sensor types and behaviors.

## Installation

To use the C++ Sensor Simulator, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RobertAldenFreeman/EspressoSimulator
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd cpp-sensor-simulator
   ```

3. Compile the C++ code using your preferred compiler:

   ```bash
   g++ simulator.cpp -o simulator -std=c++11
   ```

## Usage

After compiling the simulator, you can start generating simulated sensor data as follows:

1. Create a simulation file (e.g., `sim.txt`) with the following format:

   ```
   sensor_type,pin,min,max,duration,frequency
   end
   ```

   - `sensor_type`: Type of the sensor (e.g., temperature, pressure).
   - `pin`: Pin associated with the sensor.
   - `min`: Minimum value for generated data.
   - `max`: Maximum value for generated data.
   - `duration`: Length of the simulation (in seconds).
   - `frequency`: Time between generating new values (in milliseconds).
   - `end`: Marks the end of a block of lines to simulate concurrently.

   Example:
   ```
   temperature,1,20,30,60,1000
   pressure,2,80,120,45,500
   end
   temperature,3,15,25,30,500
   ```

2. Start the simulator by running the compiled executable:

   ```bash
   ./simulator sim.txt
   ```

   Replace `sim.txt` with the path to your simulation file.

3. The simulator will read the configuration from the simulation file and start generating sensor data based on the specified parameters.

4. Monitor the generated data or integrate it with your software for testing and development.

## Configuration

The simulation file (`sim.txt`) is used to configure the sensor simulation. Each line specifies a sensor type, its properties, and simulation parameters. Use the `end` keyword to mark the end of a block of lines to simulate concurrently.
